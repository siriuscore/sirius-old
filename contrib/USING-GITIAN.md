Using Gitian
====================
### Setting up GPG keys
Generate GPG key on your computer:
1. ```gpg --gen-key ```(choose RSA and RSA, size 4096 byte, name and email should be the same like on Github)
2. ```gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG ```(We are interested in the first line after 4096R/)
3. ```gpg --armor --export 3AA5C34371567BD2```(Enter the hash from previous command)
Copy got gpg key into the /contrib/gitian-keys/ folder with .pgp format.
### Setting up Gitian
1. Replace .yml files in sirius/contrib/gitian-descriptors folder. Replace gitian-build.sh in sirius/contrib folder. Add windeploy/ folder into the sirius/contrib. Push these changes to remote repository https://github.com/siriusproject/sirius/. Also very important, windeploy/ folder should be The same version as you want to build. You will couldn't build win binaries without this folder in version which you want to build.
2. gitian-build.sh script should be started from directory where sirius places(like in instruction).
##### First time / New Gitian builders
These actions are executed once when first using gitian-builder. If you have used gitian-builder for sirius skip these steps.
1. ```sirius/contrib/gitian-build.sh --setup``` This command create and setup virtual machines to build your binaries files. This command may take a while (about 40 minutes). If you want to use KVM as build VM , run script with ```--kvm```.
    ```sirius/contrib/gitian-build.sh --setup --kvm```

2. Create the OS X SDK tarball( https://github.com/siriusproject/sirius/blob/master/doc/README_osx.md), create inputs/ folder in gitian-builder/ . Copy MacOSX10.11.sdk.tar.gz into the inputs/ directory.
##### Not first time
Ensure that the ./gitian.sigs directory is up to date for signs verifying.

    pushd ./gitian.sigs
    git pull
    popd

Ensure that the ./gitian-builder directory is up to date.

    pushd ./gitian-builder
    git pull
    popd

### Build and sign Sirius for Linux, Windows, and OS X:

  ```sirius/contrib/gitian-build.sh --build --signer signer version``` or 
  ```sirius/contrib/gitian-build.sh --build --kvm --signer signer version```

signer â€” GPG Signer sign assert files for builds (name you entered with GPG key creation). When script is running you must specify passphrase. Use passphrase you entered with the GPG key creation. 

version - tag or branch of Github.

You can set false for a certain os in gitian-build.sh if you aren't interested in it building.
Script will be running about 1h or more.

When script is running you may check state of installation and build progress with:

    tail -f var/install.log
    tail -f var/build.log
    
Output will look something like:
    
    Initialized empty Git repository in /home/gitianuser/gitian-builder/inputs/sirius/.git/

    remote: Total 57959 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 57958

Binaries will be in sirius-binaries/ . Signatures will appear in gitian.sigs/ . Signatures will be committed and you should push it manually. Sigs haven't committed with ```--no-commit```.

Build output expected:

  1. source tarball (`sirius-${VERSION}.tar.gz`)
  2. linux 32-bit and 64-bit dist tarballs (`sirius-${VERSION}-linux[32|64].tar.gz`)
  3. windows 32-bit and 64-bit unsigned installers and dist zips (`sirius-${VERSION}-win[32|64]-setup-unsigned.exe`, `sirius-${VERSION}-win[32|64].zip`)
  4. OS X unsigned installer and dist tarball (`sirius-${VERSION}-osx-unsigned.dmg`, `sirius-${VERSION}-osx64.tar.gz`)
  5. Gitian signatures (in `gitian.sigs/${VERSION}-<linux|{win,osx}-unsigned>/(your Gitian key)/`)

### Verify other gitian builders signatures to your own. (Optional)

Add other gitian builders keys to your gpg keyring

    gpg --import sirius/contrib/gitian-keys/*.pgp
    gpg --refresh-keys

Verify the signatures

    pushd ./gitian-builder
    ./bin/gverify -v -d ../gitian.sigs/ -r ${VERSION}-linux ../sirius/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-linux.yml
    ./bin/gverify -v -d ../gitian.sigs/ -r ${VERSION}-win-unsigned ../sirius/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win.yml
    ./bin/gverify -v -d ../gitian.sigs/ -r ${VERSION}-osx-unsigned ../sirius/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-osx.yml
    popd

### Next steps:

Codesigner only: Sign the osx binary:

    transfer sirius-osx-unsigned.tar.gz to osx for signing
    tar xf sirius-osx-unsigned.tar.gz
    ./detached-sig-create.sh -s "Key ID"
    Enter the keychain password and authorize the signature
    Move signature-osx.tar.gz back to the gitian host

Codesigner only: Sign the windows binaries:

    tar xf sirius-win-unsigned.tar.gz
    ./detached-sig-create.sh -key /path/to/codesign.key
    Enter the passphrase for the key when prompted
    signature-win.tar.gz will be created

Codesigner only: Commit the detached codesign payloads:

    cd /path/to/sirius-detached-sigs
    checkout the appropriate branch for this release series
    rm -rf *
    tar xf signature-osx.tar.gz
    tar xf signature-win.tar.gz
    git add -a
    git commit -m "point to ${VERSION}"
    git push the current branch

Non-codesigners: wait for Windows/OS X detached signatures:

    Once the Windows/OS X builds each have 3 matching signatures, they will be signed with their respective release keys.
    Detached signatures will then be committed to the sirius-detached-sigs repository, which can be combined with the unsigned apps to create signed binaries.

Create the signed OS X binary:
```sirius/contrib/gitian-build.sh --sign -o x --signer signer version```

Create the signed Win binary:
```sirius/contrib/gitian-build.sh --sign -o w --signer signer version```

Commit your signed signatures for OS X and Win.
You can verify all binaries with:
```sirius/contrib/gitian-build.sh --verify version```
